Bring you down here in the dead of night
Keep you working
Try to survive
We are secretly watching you too
Trying our best to get at you
Run
You can run
You can't hide
We'll always seek
We'll always find
You can run
But you can't hide
We'll always seek
We'll always find
You can run
You can try
You can run
But you can't hide
You can run
You can try
You can run
But you can't hide
They're laughing while finding
I'm hiding, I'm trying
I feel like she's lying
I feel like I'm dying
She's guiding me quietly
Instructing me blindly
Afraid of what might be
I feel like I'm dying
Hide
I hear a sound
(It's prolly just a mouse)
I see them in the dark
(I only saw a spark)
I know there's someone there
(Not as far as I'm aware)
Why don't you believe me?
Maybe you're right
(It's just another night)
But I heard a creak
(Just go back to sleep)
I'm always quick to rage
(So go back to your stage)
(Wait... Now I hear it...) Run
What's that sound?
I know someone's there
Hiding in the shadows
Thinking I was unaware
Who's that I see?
The birthday boy to be
Let's invite him over
Hurry up before he's bolder
Oh Bon-Bon
Let's make this fun
You can't deter me this time
No I'm done
I won't go back to my stage
It's my new trend
Well, let's go say hi to the new friend
I knew I was right to think I would find you over here
Well isn't it intriguing that
You seem to be just a little bit weary
Of Bon-Bon and me
Well there's no need
We know you want to deactivate us
But we just can't let that happen
Every night always, it never changes
But we can make accidents happen
We can make accidents happen
We can make accidents happen
We can make accidents happen
We can make accidents happen
